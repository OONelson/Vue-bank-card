# Vue-bank-card

* I tried to turn my frontend mentor project to a Vue project although i did'nt follow all the guidelines.

1. users should be able to input their details and see it display on the front and back card
2. if the details given is valid they should see a success write up
3. if details are not valid an alert will pop up
